# Phishing Domain Detection

<font color='limegreen' style='background-color:black'>**What is phishing?**</font>

<font color='limegreen' style='background-color:black'>Phishing is a well-known, computer-based, social engineering technique. Attackers use disguised email addresses as a weapon to target large companies.</font>

<font color='limegreen' style='background-color:black'>**These projects are:**</font>
1. <font color='limegreen' style='background-color:black'>**Phishing detection with logistic regression**</font>
   - Logistic regression can be utilized to detect patterns in phishing domains, making it easier to prevent attacks by identifying suspicious URLs.
   
2. <font color='limegreen' style='background-color:black'>**Phishing detection with decision trees**</font>
   - Decision trees help classify email content and metadata, aiding in the identification of phishing attempts through pattern recognition.

3. <font color='limegreen' style='background-color:black'>**Spam email detection with natural language processing (NLP)**</font>
   - NLP techniques can be employed to analyze and filter out malicious emails by recognizing phishing language and context.

<font color='limegreen' style='background-color:black'>**Red Team Use Case**</font>

<font color='limegreen' style='background-color:black'>Red team operators/engineers can use these projects to simulate phishing attacks during red team engagements, helping to test and improve an organizationâ€™s defenses against social engineering attacks. By understanding the detection mechanisms, they can craft more sophisticated phishing scenarios that bypass existing security measures, providing valuable insights into potential vulnerabilities.</font>
